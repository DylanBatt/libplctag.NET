# Contributing

First off, welcome and thanks for taking the time to contribute!

libplctag.NET is a wrapper for libplctag, and as such is intended to expose libplctag functionality in a way that is convenient to use in .NET applications.

## How can I contribute?

### Reporting bugs
Please review existing [github issues](https://github.com/libplctag/libplctag.NET/issues?q=is%3Aissue]). Feel free to add additional information or just add that you're hitting the same issue.

Bugs can be complex to analyse, so it is important that you provide as much context as possible.
Depending on the problem you're facing, useful information could include:
1. A minimal code snippet repro, or other code you have tried.
2. Target device (e.g. CompactLogix 1769-L23E-QB1B, or Omron CJ2M, or the libplctag simulator).
3. Environment (i.e. Operating System).
4. Debug logs from libplctag core (see [this example](https://github.com/libplctag/libplctag.NET/blob/master/src/Examples/CSharp%20DotNetCore/LoggingExample.cs)).
